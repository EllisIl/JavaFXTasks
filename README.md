# Overview

In this project, I aimed to enhance my skills as a software engineer by developing a task management application using JavaFX. This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of Java programming, GUI design, and user interaction handling, which are crucial skills in building real-world applications.

The software is a task management application that enables users to add, view, mark tasks as complete, and filter tasks by category. Each task is represented with a checkbox in the interface, allowing users to track their progress effectively.

The primary goal of writing this software was to practice integrating JavaFX for building an intuitive user interface and to strengthen my problem-solving skills in designing functional software features.

# Development Environment

I used IntelliJ IDEA as the primary integrated development environment (IDE) for this project. The application was developed using:

- **Programming Language**: Java (JDK 17)
- **Frameworks/Libraries**: JavaFX for the graphical user interface

# Useful Websites

- [JavaFX Documentation](https://openjfx.io/): Essential resource for learning JavaFX components and APIs.
- [Oracle Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/): For understanding Java language syntax and libraries.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/): Helpful for troubleshooting and finding coding solutions.

# Future Work

- Add a feature to edit existing tasks.
- Implement task due dates and notifications.
- Improve the UI/UX with JavaFX CSS for better visual appeal.
- Add functionality to filter tasks based on their completion status.
- Integrate file-based saving to retain task data between sessions.
